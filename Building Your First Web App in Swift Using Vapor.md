In WWDC 2015, Apple announced that Swift would be open source. Shortly after that, in December 2015, Swift’s codebase was public on [GitHub](https://github.com/apple/swift).

Open sourcing the Swift codebase introduces developers to a multitude of opportunities and expand the use of Swift worldwide.

As expected, developers swiftly explored the various new applications of Swift (no pun intended). One such application is using swift code to power a web app which we will explore in this tutorial.
